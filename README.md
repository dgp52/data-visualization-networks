# Data Visualization - Visualization and Implications of Different networks

The purpose of this report is to analyze each network and apply different algorithms to detect
communities, authoritative nodes, influential nodes, and broadcasting nodes that can quickly spread information
throughout a network. Using all this information, we can find common interests between the entities, design
recommendation systems, and even try to systematically remove most central nodes to study how the network
might behave in the foreseeable future. Network analysis has many implications, the analysis and different
methods shown in this paper are no way limited to these datasets, therefore they will be generalized and
the idea can still be applied to any type of network.
